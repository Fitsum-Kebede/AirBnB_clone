# Introduction:
Welcome to the Airbnb Clone Project! This application is designed to
replicate the core functionalities of the popular accommodation booking platform,
Airbnb. The project aims to provide familiar and intuitive functionalities for:
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

This README is a guide through the features, technologies used, setup instructions, and more.
